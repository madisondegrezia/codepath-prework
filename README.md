## "Hello World" App

This is my first app written in the swift language utilizing XCode. The app displayed Hello and there were numerous buttons that changed the background view color, the text color, changed the text of the label to Goodbye ðŸ‘‹, and allowed the user to input a string to be displayed when clicked.
